# tma-string-finder
A program that lets you specify a range of Magnus Archives episodes to search for a specific string. Includes the ability to either return the episodes containing the string, or return the sentences in each episode containing the string. 

## How to use:
The program will provide you with instructions when run. It will prompt you to give the episodes to begin and end searching, the string you're searching for, and whether you want it to print sentences. 

This program is dumb. By that I mean that I've put little effort into making it catch bad user input.
